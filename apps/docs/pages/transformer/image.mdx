# Image Data

> ðŸš§ WIP - This section is still a work in progress and not finished yet.

## Functions

```js
purpose({
  transformers: [image.blur_faces()],
});
```

This transformer will automatically blur all faces in an image.
We utilize our [faceblur server](https://github.com/s3bastiankoch/faceblur).
To run it, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker build -t faceblur . && docker run -d -p 5000:5000 -t faceblur
```

The server is based on [yolov8-face](https://github.com/derronqi/yolov8-face/tree/main) by [derronqi](https://github.com/derronqi).
We wrapped a simple flask server around it. The integration with our proxy is still being worked on.
