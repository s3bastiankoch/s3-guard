# Access Control

We utilize an extended runtime of the Open Policy Agent (OPA) to enforce access control policies.
For more information on how to define access policies using OPA, see [https://www.openpolicyagent.org/](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/).
Users can use the full power and flexibility of OPA to define their access control policies. However we provide a set of abstractions to make
easier to define purpose based access control policies for example.
