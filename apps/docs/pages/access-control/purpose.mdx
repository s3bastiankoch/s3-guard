# Purpose based access

Purpose based access control is a way to define access control policies based on the purpose of the data. The GDPR
requires that data is only used for the purpose it was collected for. We allow combining purpose based access control with
data transformations.

## Example

```js
purpose1 := purpose({
	"transformers": [tabular.allow_columns(["name", "age"])]
})

```

By passing the purpose as an context to an S3 data access request, the data will be transformed before it is returned.

```
GET /<fileName>?p_purpose=purpose1
```

Our proxy will automatically determine the data type that is being accessed and apply the correct transformer.
In the example above we are assuming the provided access policy is associated with tabular data from a CSV-file for example.
By default no data access is allowed and specific purposed allow explicitly certain columns to be accessed. In our example
`name` and `age`.
The transformers we provide are being explained more in detail under the [transformer section](/transformer).
If no purpose from the provided context is matching against any policy definition no data will get returned.

## Building a purpose graph

We extended the idea of a flat list of policies to allow arbtrary graphs of purposes by specifying the optional `specifies` property.

```js
purpose1 := purpose({
	"transformers": [tabular.allow_columns(["name", "age"])]
})

purpose2 := purpose({
	"specifies": [purpose1],
	"transformers": [tabular.allow_columns(["address"])]
})

```

This example defines a very simple tree of purposed where the purpose `purpose2` is inheriting from `purpose1`. This means that
`purpose2` is allowed to access all columns that `purpose1` is allowed to access. In addition `purpose2` is allowed to access
the `address` column.
