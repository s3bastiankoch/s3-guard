# Clients

We provide a convinient wrapper for the official AWS S3 client to integrate with our proxy.
Currently only a javascript client is available while making requests compatible with our proxy server
is straightforward and can be done with any client.

## Javascript

The javascript client is available as an npm package: `@s3-guard/core` and can be installed with `npm install @s3-guard/core`.
The `wrapClient` function takes an AWS S3 client and returns a wrapped client that will make requests compatible with our proxy.
We add a `setContext` method to the client that allows you to set the context of the request before making it.

```javascript
import { wrapClient } from "@s3-guard/core";
import { S3Client } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";

const client = wrapClient(
  new S3Client({
    endpoint: process.env.OUR_PROXY_URL,
  })
);

await client
  .setContext({
    purpose: "purpose1",
  })
  .send(
    new GetObjectCommand({
      Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET_NAME,
      Key: fileName,
    })
  );
```

The context we are setting here will be added to the requests and is passed to access policies under `input.*`.
The purpose field is a reserved field that is used to match the request against purposes defined in the access policy.
Setting the context is optional and if you don't set it, the request will be made without a context.

## How it works

When wrapping the official AWS S3 client, we intercept the `send` method and add the context of the request
to the URL as a query parameter. We prefix the url parameters with `p_` to hint the proxy which parameters are relevant. The example above will result in the following request:

```
GET /<fileName>?p_purpose=purpose1
```
