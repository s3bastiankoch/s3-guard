# CLI

Our CLI provides a convinient way to upload your policies to the OPA server.
Aditionally we store a config.json file in your S3 bucket to coordinate the policies in the proxy. The cli expects
the following environment variables to be set:

- `S3_URL`
- `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `S3_BUCKET_NAME`
- `OPA_SERVER_ENDPOINT`

The environment variables can also be set in a `.env` file in the current working directory.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g s3-guard
```

## Usage

```bash
s3-guard --config path/to/config.yml
```
