# Installation

## Getting Started

We assume that you already have an s3 compatible bucket ready and deployed somewhere.

You can clone our repository using git:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/s3bastiankoch/s3-guard.git && cd s3-guard
```

After changing the directory to `s3-gaurd` you can create a .env.local file with the following structure:

```sh
S3_URL=
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
S3_BUCKET_NAME=
OPA_SERVER_ENDPOINT=
```

Depending how you have setup your S3 bucket you have to obtain the credentials for your bucket.

Finanlly you can start the proxy and the OPA server using docker compose:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

Using our CLI you can deploy your first policy. To install our CLI via npm:

```sh
npm install -g s3-guard
```

### Your first access control rule

The CLI needs to know where to find your OPA server and your S3 bucket which is defined in your .env file.

You can write your first policy in rego and save it as `example.rego`:

```js
puporse1 := purpose({
	"transformers": []
})
```

### The config.yml

The config.yml defines the rules which should be deployed to your OPA server. You can define multiple rules in the config.yml.
You need to point in each rule to the policy file, in our case the `example.rego` file with just defined.
The `match` section defines which files should be matched by the rule. The example is matching all files with the extension `.csv`.

```yaml
rules:
	- name: Our first policy
	  description:
	  policy: ./example.rego

	  match:
	  	paths:
			- *.csv
```

Now we can deploy the config:

```sh
s3-guard --config config.yml
```
