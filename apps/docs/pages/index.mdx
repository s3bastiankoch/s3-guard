# Welcome to S3 Guard

S3 Guard is an s3-compatible proxy trying to enable developers to be compliant with privacy laws.

## Getting Started

We assume that you already have am s3 compatible bucket ready.

To run the proxy via docker:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/s3bastiankoch/s3-guard.git && cd s3-guard && docker-compose up -d
```

Next you need our cli:

```sh
npm install -g s3-guard
```

### Your first access control rule

We will now develop our first access control.

```js
puporse1 := purpose()
```

### The config.yml

```yaml
rules:
	- name: Our first policy
	  description:
	  policy: ./example.rego

	  match:
	  	paths:
			- *.csv
```

Now we can deploy the config:

```sh
s3-guard --config config.yml
```
