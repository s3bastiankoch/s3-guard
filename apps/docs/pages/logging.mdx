# Logging Service

To enhance transparency of data usage patterns for the user we have integrated an optional logging service.
Whenever data is being access through our proxy the data access is being logged along with information about the context
in which the data is being accessed. We log the time of access and whether the access was successful or not.
If the context includes a purpose we log the purpose as well. This information can be used to present
the user with a summary of the data usage patterns in the UI of your application.
We do not log the data itself.
To allow easy adaptability to your application we rely on a adapter patter where you can use your own SQL database
like MySQL or PostgreSQL to store the logs.
By passing a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to the proxy you can enable the logging. If no database is specified
the logging is disabled.
