# Outlook

The project is early staged and was primarily conducted as a research project, meaning that the code is not production ready yet.
We are planning to add more features and transformers in the future. Possible transformations include working with text data
from PDF-files for example and automatically remove sensitive information from the text.

As outlined in the [benchmark section](/benchmark) we currently see a lot of room for improvement in terms of performance and added latency.

Further we want to enhance the scability of the work by providing deployment options in FaaS environments like AWS Lambda or Azure Functions.
Currently a deployment on the edge via Cloudflare Workers is possible but the setup is not yet fully documented.
