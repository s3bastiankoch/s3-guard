# Benchmark

The following benchmark compares direct S3 data access with our component.
The S3 bucket for this benchmark is hosted as an Cloudflare R2 Storage Bucket in a similar region as the proxy. The proxy is running on
Hetzner.
After an initial warm up phase we are running a load test with on average 5 requests per second for 60 seconds. We are
measuring the latency introduced by our component. The proxy is checking against one access policy and no transformers are being used.
The code for this benchmark can be found [here](https://github.com/s3bastiankoch/s3-guard/tree/main/packages/evaluation).

## Results

The table is showing response times in milliseconds. The first row is showing the latency of the S3 bucket without our proxy.
The second row is showing the latency of the S3 bucket with our proxy.
| | min | max | median | p95 | p99 |
| -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Without proxy | 108 | 923 | 153 | 257.3 | 441.5 |
| With proxy | 279 | 962 | 333.7 | 608 | 907 |

## Interpretation

Even with a very simple setup we already see an increase in latency.
This is due to an additional network hop for checking the policy on the OPA Server.
With introducing more complex policies and transformers the latency will increase significantly.
Our component adds overhead and latency when accessing data.
Since this project is early-staged many optimizations are still missing.

## Potential Optimizations

Our proxy is edge-compatible and could be for example deployed on [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com).
By integrating an intelligent caching strategy we could reduce the latency and overhead significantly.
